# Semantic segmentation of aerial (satellite) imagery
For the task of semantic segmentation of aerial (satellite) imagery, the U-Net architecture has proven to be an effective solution presented a Python implementation 
of U-Net that utilizes various techniques to improve its performance.
## The implementation consists of two main parts: 
1. Data preprocessing 
2. Model architecture.

 In the data preprocessing part, we performed various operations such as data augmentation, 
normalization, and resizing to prepare the input data for training. In the model architecture 
part, we implemented a multi-class U-Net model that uses multiple convolutional and maxpooling layers in the encoder part and multiple convolutional and upsampling layers in the 
decoder part. We also used skip connections to combine the features from the encoder and 
decoder parts.
To evaluate the performance of our implementation, we used the Jaccard coefficient as a 
metric. The Jaccard coefficient measures the similarity between the ground truth and 
predicted segmentation masks. We defined a custom function to calculate the Jaccard 
coefficient and used it as a metric during training and evaluation.
Based on our experiments, we can conclude that the U-Net architecture is a powerful tool for 
semantic segmentation of aerial (satellite) imagery. Our implementation achieved high 
accuracy and a high Jaccard coefficient on the test dataset. The results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the U-Net architecture for this task and the potential for using it in real-world 
applications.
In conclusion, the U-Net architecture is a promising approach for semantic segmentation of 
aerial (satellite) imagery, and our implementation provides a useful starting point for further 
research and development in this area.
